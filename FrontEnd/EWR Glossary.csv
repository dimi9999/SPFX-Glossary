In the past, safety requirements may have been used as a barrier to open competition across the EU. The intention of the CSM RA is to harmonise processes for risk evaluation and assessment and the evidence and documentation produced during the application of these processes. By applying a common process, it will be easier for an assessment undertaken in one EU Member State to be accepted in another with the minimum of further work. This is referred to as ‘mutual recognition’.","[""Industry""]",,,,,"Approved",,,"156","C"

LENNON applies agreed (between TOCs) allocation factors and allocation factors created by ORCATS. LENNON calculates rail industry commission to ticket sellers, which varies between 9% - 2% of the sale price depending on product, face to face or remote sale. Commission is funded by the TOC in proportion to sales received. Example: if TOC A receives 59% of the sale as earnings. They pay 59% of the commission.

The degree to which a relationship can be established between two or more products of the development process, especially products having a predecessor-successor or master subordinate relationship to one another; e.g. the degree to which the Requirements and the design of a given System element match.
